          <p>After WW1</p>
          <br>
          <p>Germany and its people were embarrassed, and, so Hitler wanted vengeance for the many lives lost on their side being in vain. Just like America, before World War 2, Germany was hit with a major economic depression. Women also got the right to vote. In 1921, Hitler was arrested for attempting to overthrow the government. Once he got out of jail, people began to follow him and read his book, there was much propaganda about Nazism. Soon, Hitler began his charismatic rise. Hitler ended up rising to power without being voted, instead he was given a deal by the government. There was a major fire and Hitler blamed the jews, which ended up building hate for jewish people. Hitler also gave many speeches to increase his charisma and trust with the people of Germany. Later, when the leader of Germany was dead, Hitler became the total dictator.</p>

          <p>The Holocaust</p>
          <br>
          <p>  In 1933 the first concentration camp opened and discrimination against jews began. There were boycotts against jewish owned stores. Laws were put into place so that most jews would go into poverty quickly. Around 1938 Germany invaded Austria. In only one year, Austria had started to discriminate against jews. Then, Hitler began walking up into neighboring countries with armed forces, and without any fight back, Hitler took the land. After awhile, Germanyâ€™s government authorized the mass murder of jewish people.</p>
